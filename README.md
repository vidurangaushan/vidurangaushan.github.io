### Experience

#### IT Branch - Survey Department, Sri Lanka
**Intern Data & Database Analyst**  
07.2023 – 04.2024  
- I worked on a few relational and non-relational databases, optimizing databases, and migrating old(MySQL) databases to new(MSSQL) databases.
- Migrated a heavy database regarding Land information to a new MSSQL database. This migration process performs some data transformation processes to handle noisy data such as missing values.
- Developed a dashboard to analyze and visualize field data using Power BI and MSSQL schemas.
- Configure a new server to deploy applications and databases. This project uses SAN storage to create clusters and store data following applicable RAID principles. Using Vcenter to create virtual machines for deployment purposes.

### Projects & Activities

#### Data Migration Project
- Migrated heavy databases like millions of records to a new MSSQL database. This migration process performs some data transformation processes to handle noisy data such as missing values. Here develop a pipeline using the SSIS tool to migrate PostgreSQL data to the MSSQL server.
- Use MSSQL Server, MSSQL server miration assist, SSIS data tools

#### Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Project
- Designing a comprehensive data warehouse schema and developing the data warehouse architecture within an SQL server environment. This included the creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) package to efficiently load OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) data into the data warehouse. Additionally, I was responsible for visualizing the data using Power BI dashboards, providing insightful and interactive representations of the data. 
- The tools and technologies employed for this project included MSSQL Server, Visual Studio, Power BI, and SQL. 

#### Data Mining Project
- Developed a job satisfaction level predictor based on a publicly available dataset. Using Python as the primary programming language, we built and implemented the predictive model. 
- The project utilized Flask for creating the web application interface, and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development. 

#### MERN Project
- Development of a web-based Tourism and Hospitality Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). My role involved designing and implementing various components of the system to enhance user experience and functionality.
- The primary programming language used for this project was Java, and the development environment was set up in Visual Studio Code.
